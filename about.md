I'm originally from Milwaukee, Wisconsin and I received my B.A. in Political Science from the University of Notre Dame in 2010. After completing undergraduate, I taught middle school in Fort Worth, TX through the Alliance for Catholic Education, a program administered through Notre Dame. I earned my M.Ed. and continued teaching for an additional year.

I am a currently graduate student in the Government Department at the University of Texas at Austin. My research interests focus on the political determinants of education outputs and outcomes in Latin America. Please contact me with any questions or if you would like a copy of any of my work.
