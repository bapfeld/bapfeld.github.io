I'm originally from Milwaukee, Wisconsin and I received my B.A. in Political Science from the University of Notre Dame in 2010. After completing my undergraduate education, I taught middle school in Fort Worth, TX through the Alliance for Catholic Education's Teaching Fellows Program, a program administered through Notre Dame. I earned my M.Ed. and continued teaching for an additional year.

I am currently a PhD candidate in the Government Department at the University of Texas at Austin. My research interests focus on the politics of education --- both the role that politics has in shaping education systems and learning outcomes and in the effect that education has on politics and political institutions, particularly in Latin America. Please contact me with any questions or if you would like a copy of any of my work.
