I'm currently a data scientist at CVS Health. My research interests center around questions on democracy, democratization, and the politics of education. I research how democracies come to be, how they are shaped by education, and how they in turn shape their education systems. I'm also interested in political methodology and finding new ways to provide more precise answers to difficult questions.

I hold a PhD in political science from the University of Texas at Austin, and both an MEd and a BA from the University of Notre Dame. I have been the instructor of record for university level courses and taught for several years at a small K-8 school in Fort Worth, Texas.
