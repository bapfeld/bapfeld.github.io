Last year I gave a brief presentation on dealing with bibliographies in LaTeX. I'd meant to write something up about it at the time, but clearly I never got around to it. So this is just a brief FYI. You can view the full presentation [here](http://www.brendanapfeld.com/presentations/latex-bib/latex_bibs.html) and the full materials for it, including some working examples are available [here](https://github.com/bapfeld/latex-bibliographies).
