Welcome! I am a data scientist at CVS Health. I also research questions related to democracy and the politics of education. I am interested in the forces that shape democracy, particularly education, and how democratic governments in turn shape their education systems. I hold a PhD in political science from the Government Department at the University of Texas at Austin. Please contact me with any questions or if you would like a copy of any of my work.
