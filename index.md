Welcome! I am a PhD candidate in the Government Department at the University of Texas at Austin. My research interests focus on the politics of education --- both the role that politics has in shaping education systems and learning outcomes and in the effect that education has on politics and political institutions, particularly in Latin America. Please contact me with any questions or if you would like a copy of any of my work.
